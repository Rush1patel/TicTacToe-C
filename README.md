## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built purely with fundamental, yet powerful tools:

*   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/c/c-original.svg" alt="C Language" width="20" height="20"/> **C Programming Language:** The core logic and engine of the game, structured into `main.c`, `tictactoe.c`, and `tictactoe.h`.
*   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/gcc/gcc-original.svg" alt="GCC" width="20" height="20"/> **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):** (Or your preferred C compiler like Clang) Used for compiling the `main.c` and `tictactoe.c` source files and linking them.
*   **Standard C Libraries:** `stdio.h` for input/output operations.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to play? Follow these simple steps to get the game running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) installed on your system.
*   Git (for cloning the repository, or you can download the `main.c`, `tictactoe.c`, and `tictactoe.h` files directly).
*   A terminal or command-line interface.

### Installation & Compilation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rush1patel/TicTacToe-C.git
    cd TicTacToe-C
    ```
    Alternatively, you can download the `main.c`, `tictactoe.c`, and `tictactoe.h` files into the same directory.

2.  **Compile the Game:**
    Navigate to the directory containing `main.c`, `tictactoe.c`, and `tictactoe.h`. Compile the source files using GCC (or your preferred C compiler):
    gcc main.c tictactoe.c -o tictactoe -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99
    ```
    *   `main.c tictactoe.c`: Your C source files. `main.c` typically contains the `main()` function and program flow, while `tictactoe.c` contains the game logic functions.
*   `tictactoe.h`: The header file providing function declarations and shared definitions, included by your `.c` files.
    *   `-o tictactoe`: Specifies the output executable name as `tictactoe`.
    *   `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`: Enables most compiler warnings for better code quality (recommended).
    *   `-std=c99`: Specifies the C99 standard.

3.  **Run the Game:**
    Once compiled successfully, execute the program:
    ```bash
    ./tictactoe
    ```

## üìñ How to Play

The rules are simple, the challenge is eternal!

1.  After running the game, the initial 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board will be displayed with numbered cells:
    ```
            |           |         
       1    |     2     |     3    
            |           |         
    ------------------------------
            |           |         
       4    |     5     |    6     
            |           |         
    ------------------------------
            |           |         
       7    |     8     |     9    
            |           |         
    ```
2.  **Player X** always starts the game.
3.  You will be prompted: `Type your answer Player X : `
4.  Enter the **number (1-9)** corresponding to the cell where you want to place your mark.
5.  If the move is valid, your mark ('X' or 'O') will be placed, and the board will be redisplayed.
6.  **Player O** takes the next turn.
7.  Players alternate turns until one of the following occurs:
    *   üëë **Victory!** A player successfully aligns three of their marks. The game will announce the winner.
    *   ü§ù **Stalemate!** All nine cells are filled, and no player has won. The game will declare a draw.
8.  The game concludes after a win or a draw. To play again, re-run the executable.

## ‚ú® Peek into the Code: The `win()` Function

Here's a glimpse of the core logic (typically found in `tictactoe.c`) that determines a victor.

## üîÆ Future Adventures (Planned Enhancements)

Here are some exciting features planned for future updates:

-   ü§ñ **AI Opponent:** Implement a single-player mode where you can challenge an AI.
-   üîÅ **Play Again Option:** Allow players to easily start a new game without re-running the program.
-   üìä **Score Tracking:** Implement a system to keep track of scores across multiple games.
-   üé® **Enhanced UI (ncurses):** Explore using the ncurses library for a richer and more interactive terminal-based user interface.
